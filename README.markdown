[GhostWriter](http://github.com/jpld/GhostWriter/)
=============
quartz composer plug-in to write an image to disk. patch acts on the rising edge of the Write Signal input.

[Download - GhostWriter-0.1.1.zip](http://cloud.github.com/downloads/jpld/GhostWriter/GhostWriter-0.1.1.zip)

to install from the binary download, move _GhostWriter.plugin_ to _~/Library/Graphics/Quartz Composer Plug-Ins/_, and to install from source, simply build the _Build & Copy_ project target.

GhostWriter is not unlike ImageWriter, the developer example plug-in from apple, but offers further control of when to write the file to disk and the naming of the resulting file. build and runtime requires Mac OS X 10.6 or later.
